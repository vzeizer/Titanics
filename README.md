# Project of Titanic Data Set of Udacity

## Overview of the project
In this project, you will analyze a data set and, afterwards, communicate your conclusions about the subject.
You are going to use NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib libraries to facilitate your analysis.

## What to install?

-> Python 3.4 or greater
-> pandas
-> numpy
-> matplotlib
-> csv


#Introduction

For the final project, you will do your own data analysis and create a file that documents your discoveries and can be shared.
You will begin by taking a look at the dataset and making a question brainstorming and answer them. 
Afterwards, you should use Pandas and NumPy to answer the questions which most interests you and create a report by sharing your answers.
You are not forced to use statistics nor deep learning to finish this project, but it must be clear in your communication that your conclusions are not definite
This project is open, in the sense that we are not looking for an exact answer.
